Description: Built off of the sleepwalk package for single-cell data 
  (S. Ovchinnikova and S. Anders), KnnSleepwalk allows the user to take two or 
  more plots, and compare the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of one to the KNN of the 
  other. The common use case is to take two UMAPs, and display the KNN of UMAP 
  space on one, and the KNN of the original high-dimensional space on the other.
